## Introduction

It all began with a YouTube video that led me to Circuitbeard's
[amazing project](https://circuitbeard.co.uk/2017/08/28/tomy-turnin-turbo-dashboard-outrun-arcade/)
to convert a Tomy Turnin' Turbo Dashboard toy from the 1980s into a
[Sega Out Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run) arcade game, complete with active
electronic dashboard.

Despite having never attempted anything similar, I felt compelled to try and do something similar.
Thankfully, Circuitbeard was kind enough to
[document](https://circuitbeard.co.uk/2017/08/28/tomy-turnin-turbo-dashboard-outrun-arcade/)
the entire build process, so I could follow in his footsteps.

However, I wanted to do something a little different, rather than just replicate his work.
So I decided to modify the dashboard component. Instead of using LEDs to re-create
the original toy's mechanical dashboard, I would fit another LCD screen and use a full digital
dashboard like you find in many modern cars.

This was the result:
