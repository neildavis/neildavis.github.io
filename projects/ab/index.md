This is part of a series of posts on my Tiger / Grandstand After Burner Tabletop Arcade Conversion:

â€¢ Introduction **<- you are here**

## Introduction

In 1987, [Sega](https://www.sega.com) launched their
[Top Gun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/) movie inspired game
[After Burner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Burner) into the arcades.

Two years later, Tiger Electronics created a
[tabletop LCD version](https://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tiger/Afterburner.htm)
of the game that you could buy and enjoy (?) at home.
This was also distributed under the 'Grandstand' brand in the UK.

Unsurpisingly the gameplay, graphics and sound of the tabletop LCD version, which cost tens of dollars/pounds,
did not compare well with the original arcade game which cost tens of thousands of dollars!

## The Challenge

Thirty years later, we now have the ability to play arcade games from that era on
inexpensive Single Board Computers (SBCs) like the
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/).
So can we now convert the tabletop game to play the original arcade game?

I post updates on the project on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/neilsnonsense/)
which will be mostly repeated here, but with more focus on the software side of things.

## The Results

This project is still WIP. Stay tuned for more updates!
